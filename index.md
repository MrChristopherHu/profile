## About Me

Hi there! I am an ethnographer who studies race, immigration, and education.
I am an incoming assistant professor of social and cultural studies in education at The University of Alabama starting in Fall 2025. 
I completed my PhD in the social foundations of education at the University of Virginia.
Previously, I was a high school chemistry teacher in rural Virginia.

- **Research & Teaching Synopsis:** My work is grounded in the social-cultural-philosophical-and-historical 
foundations of schooling and education with a focus on <i>sociology</i>. At the core of my research is an enduring
theoretical interest in understanding <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> education and the social structure of <i>race</i> are intricately
intertwined. In particular, I study Asian immigrant and Asian American communities, their perspectives on education, and
their racialization within educational contexts. The key theoretical constructs throughout my work include racialization, 
power, politics, and equity. I engage these questions through ethnographic, qualitative, and discourse analytic methods. 


## Current Projects

- **Education and the Pursuit of Success in a Chinese Immigrant Community:** My dissertation examines 
the collective cultural practices of a highly educated professional-class Chinese community in the 
white affluent suburbs of NJ. How do immigrant communities navigate racialized America? 
How do immigrant communities define what it means to be successful? 
This project is funded through a doctoral fellowship (AY24-25) awarded by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation.
- **Community-Engaged & Youth-Centered Research:** I am a graduate student researcher 
affiliated with the University of Virginia's [Equity Center](https://www.virginiaequitycenter.org/), 
which formed an educational research-practice partnership with local school districts. 
I am thinking about discourses of equity and justice in education through ethnographically grounded perspectives.
