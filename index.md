## About Me

Hi there! I am an educational ethnographer who studies race and ethnicity. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the social foundations of education at the University of Virginia's [School of Education and Human Development](https://education.virginia.edu/about/directory/christopher-hu). Previously, I was a high school chemistry teacher in rural Virginia. Questions? Want to connect? Email me at <b>[ch7dm@virginia.edu](mailto:ch7dm@virginia.edu)</b>!

## Current Projects

- **The Ethnoburban Chinese and Education:** I am in the process of finalizing my dissertation, which examines the collective cultural practices of a highly educated professional-class Chinese community in the white affluent suburbs of NJ. How do immigrant communities navigate racialized America? How are racialized groups differentially positioned in the U.S. through education? How do immigrant communities define what it means to be successful? This project is funded through a doctoral fellowship (AY24-25) awarded by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation.
- **Highly Selective Magnet High Schools:** I conducted an interview-based study with parents with children who attend highly selective, top-ranked public magnet high schools on the East Coast. Several empirical articles are published; there's one more on the way! 
- **Community-Engaged & Youth-Centered Research:** As a graduate researcher affiliated with the University of Virginia's [Equity Center](https://www.virginiaequitycenter.org/), I led an ethnographic study of an out-of-school equity intervention program designed for minoritized local youth of color and have also co-authored a study that examines language ideologies in a multilingual tutoring context. I am currently working on several manuscripts related to the politics of research-practice partnership.
