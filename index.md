## Current Projects

- **Education and the Pursuit of Success in a Chinese Immigrant Community:** My dissertation examines the collective cultural practices of a highly educated professional-class Chinese community in the white affluent suburbs of NJ. How do immigrant communities navigate racialized America? How do immigrant communities define what it means to be successful? This project is funded through a doctoral fellowship (AY24-25) awarded by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation.
- **Community-Engaged & Youth-Centered Research:** I am a graduate student researcher affiliated with the University of Virginia's [Equity Center](https://www.virginiaequitycenter.org/), which formed an educational research-practice partnership with local school districts. I am thinking about discourses of equity and justice in education through ethnographically grounded perspectives.
