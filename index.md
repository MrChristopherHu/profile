## About Me

Hi there! I am an ethnographer who studies race, immigration, and education.
I am an assistant professor of social and cultural studies in education at The University of Alabama. 
I completed my PhD in the social foundations of education at the University of Virginia.

## Synopsis 

My research and teaching are grounded in the social-cultural-philosophical-and-historical 
foundations of schooling and education. At the core of my research is an enduring
interest in understanding how and why education and the social formation of <b>race</b> are connected.
In particular, I focus on Asian immigrant and Asian American communities, their perspectives on education, and
their racialization within educational contexts. My work also centers parents, families, and community-based practices. 
Themes throughout my work include <b>racialization, space, power, and equity.</b> 
I engage these questions through ethnographic, qualitative, and discourse analytic methods. 

## Current Projects

- **Education and the Pursuit of Success in a Chinese Immigrant Community:** My dissertation examines 
the collective cultural practices of a highly educated professional-class Chinese community in the 
white affluent suburbs of NJ. My analysis focuses on how immigrant communities navigate racialized America, define
what it means to be successful, and interpret education as a modality to achieve status preservation and social esteem.
I am currently in the process of revising this work into both journal articles and an eventual monograph. 
- **Community-Engaged & Youth-Centered Research:** I am affiliated with the University of Virginia's [Center for Community Partnerships](https://www.virginiaequitycenter.org/), 
which formed an educational research-practice partnership with local school districts. 
I am thinking about discourses of equity and justice in education through ethnographically grounded perspectives.
